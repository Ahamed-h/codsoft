# 📝 Python Mini Projects

This repository contains three beginner-friendly Python projects:

1. ✅ **To-Do List Application** (`task_1.py`)
2. ✅ **Simple Calculator** (`task_2.py`)
3. ✅ **Password Generator** (`task_3.py`)

Each project demonstrates Python fundamentals like user input, loops, conditionals, functions, and libraries.

---

## 1️⃣ To-Do List Application (`task_1.py`)

A simple **task management app** to help users organize their tasks. Includes both **CLI** and **GUI (Tkinter)** versions.

### Features

* Add, view, mark as done, and delete tasks
* Choose between CLI or GUI at startup

### Run

```bash
python task_1.py
```

---

## 2️⃣ Simple Calculator (`task_2.py`)

A calculator that performs **basic arithmetic operations** based on user choice.

### Features

* Supports **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division**
* Handles invalid inputs & division by zero

### Run

```bash
python task_2.py
```

---

## 3️⃣ Password Generator (`task_3.py`)

Generates strong and random passwords of desired length.

### Features

* User specifies password length
* Uses **letters, digits, and special characters**
* Ensures randomness for security

### Run

```bash
python task_3.py
```

---

## 📌 Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Tkinter (pre-installed with Python on most systems)

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Open terminal/command prompt in the project folder.
3. Run any script using:

   ```bash
   python task_1.py
   python task_2.py
   python task_3.py
   ```

---

## 🛠️ Future Improvements

* Save To-Do list to a file or database
* GUI version for Calculator and Password Generator
* Options for password complexity (letters only, alphanumeric, strong)

---

✨ These projects are great for beginners to understand **Python basics** and small application development.

If you want, I can also **add a small table of contents with direct links to run each task** to make this README even more user-friendly. Do you want me to do that?
